You can code this to you hear content or rewrite this.

Allways give resource like this to you developers.

I have given the basics so it up to your developers to figure it out

you an add to this with the same content, just create new resource file called Dealership 1-10 or a-z if you want any cars to only be spawned at a specific dealership, and it will work fine.


Dealership a will have all the cars 'inported' on first start will all your other dealerships will have some cars. That is why you should create a new  resource file. 

This current file will have all the vehicles inported.
